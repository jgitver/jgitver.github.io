== Modes

{jgitver-doc}[jgitver] provides different ways of computing version called _'modes'_ or _'strategies'_. Each mode comes with some behavior, defaults and configuration capabilities.

Each of the modes has their own options. Those options are detailed in the configuration section of each of the mode sections below.

The mode itself is set via the strategy option:

+++ </div></details> +++

=== maven mode

[TIP]
====
The maven mode is built to reflect maven way of versioning: SNAPSHOTs and RELEASEs
====


In this mode _(which is the default mode of the jgitver maven plugin)_, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] will:

- on a DETACHED HEAD having an annotated tag, use the tag name without further computation : _mean to release_
- add SNAPSHOT qualifier to the calculated version each time it is not in the previous state : _everything is a SNAPSHOT except a release_
- increase the patch version except if it comes from a lightweight tag : _mean to start a new version pattern numbering_
- use annotated tags before lightweight ones when on a DETACHED HEAD : _reproducible builds for release_
- use lightweight tags before annotated ones when on a normal branch (master or any other branch) : _start 'next' version after release_
- add a branch qualifier on purpose : _avoid version collision for feature branches_

=== default mode

[TIP]
====
The default mode is built to reflect a standard way of versioning, each commit being uniquely identified.
====

In this mode _(which is the default mode of the jgitver gradle plugin)_, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] will:

* on a DETACHED HEAD having an annotated tag, use the tag name without further computation
* use annotated tags before lightweight ones when on a DETACHED HEAD
* use lightweight tags before annotated ones when on a normal branch (master or any other branch)
  - exception is when HEAD is on current branch, lightweight tags have precedence only when the repository is dirty
* add a branch qualifier on purpose

=== pattern mode

[TIP]
====
This mode allows some freedom to the project owner. As a project maintainer you define/configure your own pattern of versioning.
====

[WARNING]
====
The pattern mode is new in jgitver-0.7.0 and is to be considered as beta feature.
====

In this mode, {jgitver-lib}[jgitver] computes some metadatas that can be used in a pattern definition to compute the final version.

These pattern definitions are given as configuration options and should follow the grammar below.

+++ </div></details> +++

==== Pattern grammar

* A `_pattern_` consists of at least one `_pattern element_`, one after another
* A `_pattern element_` is either arbitrary characters or a `_delimited placeholder_`
** Arbitrary characters include letters, digits, or any of the four symbols "`_-.+`"
* A `_delimited placeholder_` is "`${`", followed by a `_placeholder_`, followed by "`}`"
* A `_placeholder_` is an `_inner placeholder_`, possibly with a `_prefix_` before it
* A `_prefix_` is one of any of the following:
** Arbitrary characters followed by "`:`" means the characters will always appear before the `_inner placeholder_`, even if it empty
** Arbitrary characters followed by "`~`" means the characters will appear before the `_inner placeholder_` if it is not empty
** "`<`" automatically applies a separator (hyphen between qualifier and version, period between qualifiers) to conform with strict https://semver.org/[semver rules]
* An `_inner placeholder_` is one of any of the following:
** "`v`", which will be replaced with the full calculated version number (major.minor.patch)
** "`M`", which will be replaced with the calculated major version number
** "`m`", which will be replaced with the calculated minor version number
** "`p`", which will be replaced with the calculated patch version number
** "`sys.`" followed by arbitrary characters, which will be replaced with accessing that system property (via Java's `System.getProperty`)
** "`env.`" followed by arbitrary characters, which will be replaced with accessing that environment variable (via Java's `System.getenv`)
** "`meta.`" followed by arbitrary characters, which will be replaced with accessing that meta field

==== Examples

As a simple example, the following patterns produce equivalent output:

* "`${v}`"
* "`${M}.${m}.${p}`"
* "`${meta.CALCULATED_VERSION}`"

The following pattern substitutes the commit distance for the patch number:

* "`${M}.${m}.${meta.COMMIT_DISTANCE}"

The following pattern appends the branch name and git commit ID as a qualifier, using the "`<`" prefix to use periods after the first hyphen:

* "`${v}${<meta.QUALIFIED_BRANCH_NAME}${<meta.GIT_SHA1_8}`" might produce "1.2.3-develop.a1b2c3d4"

The following pattern appends the value of an environment variable "FOO" to the version, and always adds a hyphen even if it is empty with the "`:`" prefix:

* "`${v}${-:env.FOO}`" might produce "1.2.3-bar" if the "FOO" environment variable contains "bar"
* "`${v}${-:env.FOO}`" might produce "1.2.3-" if the "FOO" environment variable is empty

Same as above but using the "`~`" prefix to optionally apply the hyphen:

* "`${v}${-~env.FOO}`" might produce "1.2.3-bar" if the "FOO" environment variable contains "bar"
* "`${v}${-~env.FOO}`" might produce "1.2.3" if the "FOO" environment variable is empty


== Maven configuration

=== Configuration file

{jgitver-maven-plugin}[Jgitver's Maven] configuration file may be placed at `$rootProjectDir/.mvn/jgitver.config.xml`.

The file should be compliant with the latest schema (given in the https://github.com/jack-r-warren/jgitver-maven-plugin/blob/master/README.md[README]). An example is below.

The file as given is the default, if a value isn't provided it is because there isn't a default. All settings are optional.

== Gradle configuration

[NOTE]
====
Configuration of the https://github.com/jgitver/gradle-jgitver-plugin[gradle-jgitver-plugin] is only supported in plugin versions above 0.2.0.

Information on behavior before that point is available in the https://github.com/jgitver/gradle-jgitver-plugin/blob/master/README.md#version--020-1[README].
====

=== Configuration block

{jgitver-gradle-plugin}[Jgitver's Gradle] configuration block is as follows.

The block as given is the default, if a value is missing it is because none is provided by default. All settings are optional.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
jgitver {
    // One of 'MAVEN', 'CONFIGURABLE', 'PATTERN'
    strategy 'CONFIGURABLE'

    // Deprecated (use strategy instead), boolean
    mavenLike false

    // One of 'MAX', 'LATEST', 'NEAREST'
    policy 'MAX'

    // Boolean
    autoIncrementPatch true

    // Boolean
    useDistance true

    // Boolean
    useDirty false

    // Boolean
    failIfDirty false

    // Boolean
    useGitCommitTimestamp false

    // Boolean
    useGitCommitID false

    // Integer between 8 and 40 inclusive
    gitCommitIDLength 8

    // Since plugin version 0.7.0, integer
    maxDepth Integer.MAX_VALUE

    // String, comma separate multiple branches
    nonQualifierBranches 'master'

    // Since plugin version 0.6.0, string, only for PATTERN strategy
    versionPattern '${v}${<meta.QUALIFIED_BRANCH_NAME}${<meta.COMMIT_DISTANCE}'

    // Since plugin version 0.6.0, string, only for PATTERN strategy
    tagVersionPattern '${v}'

    // Closure, can be set multiple times
    policy {
        // String, regex with one capture group
        pattern =
        // Array of strings, each being a transformation
        transformations = ['REPLACE_UNEXPECTED_CHARS_UNDERSCORE', 'LOWERCASE_EN']
    }

    // One of 'FIRST_PARENT', 'LOG', 'DEPTH'
    distanceCalculatorKind 'FIRST_PARENT'

    // String, regex with at least one capture group
    regexVersionTag 'v?([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+){0,2}(?:-[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]+)?)'
}
----

The branch policy can be set multiple times to set policies for different patterns. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
jgitver {
    policy {
		pattern = 'feature_(.*)'
		transformations = ['REMOVE_UNEXPECTED_CHARS', 'UPPERCASE']
	}
    policy {
		pattern = '(master)'
		transformations = ['IGNORE']
	}
}
----

For more information on all of the different options, see the configuration options for your chosen <<Modes, mode>>.

=== Multi-project builds

In a https://guides.gradle.org/creating-multi-project-builds/[multi-project] build, {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] can be enabled and globally for all projects.
Assuming that the root project and all sub-projects are in the same repository, this will keep their versions perfectly in sync.

Configuration is done in the root project's build.gradle:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
// Define plugin here (only actually applies the plugin in the root project)
plugins {
    id "fr.brouillard.oss.gradle.jgitver" version "0.9.1"
}

allprojects {

    // Ensure plugin is applied in all projects
    apply plugin: 'fr.brouillard.oss.gradle.jgitver'

    jgitver {
        // Your config goes here
    }
}
----

== IDEs usage

By providing dynamic versioning, {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] is not currently the best friend of IDEs.

But on the other hand your IDE is probably not your build tool ; so it is not a problem if it does understand all of your build pipeline.

Please refer to the instructions of your preferred IDE and if you need projects dependencies within the IDE then look
at the latest paragraph.

=== Eclipse

Having {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] setup on your project does not hurt Eclipse at all.

Just import your project as you would do normally.
Eclipse will import it using the content of your pom.xml file, it will not evaluate version using {jgitver-doc}[jgitver].

=== Intellij IDEA

Unfortunately, Intellij IDEA still does not work out of the box when {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] is there.
The problem has been reported to Intellij under the following issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-187928[IDEA-187928].

To workaround Intellij failure, you have to deactivate {jgitver-doc}[jgitver] for the import step.
For maven projects for example, open the settings `CTRL+ALT+S` and modify imports settings by adding `-Djgitver.skip=true`
as in the below image.

image:intellij-skip-jgitver.jpg[]

=== Netbeans

Exactly like Eclipse does, Netbeans just use the content of the pom.xml while importing your project.
Just import your project as you would do normally.

=== Project dependencies within IDEs

If you want to open several projects within your IDE and make project references between
those projects then having projects which version is dynamically changing is not the best way to help
your IDE keeping the references between the projects.

Especially if your are not using maven like `SNAPSHOT` but unique version for each of your commits then it is better to bypass the dynamic nature of {jgitver-doc}[jgitver].
